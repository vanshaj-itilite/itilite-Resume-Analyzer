            This page walks you through the full workflow: from uploading resumes (single or batch),
            to AI processing behind the scenes, to exploring the analytics dashboard.

            <p class="pill">Step 1</p>
            <h2>Upload Resumes (Single or Batch)</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Start on the <span class="highlight">Home / Upload</span> page. Here you can upload either a single resume
            or a batch of resumes for bulk analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Single upload</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the file picker and select a PDF or DOCX resume from your system.</li>
            <li>Optionally give this run a descriptive name (e.g. “Senior Backend – Jan batch”).</li>
            <li>Choose the AI model / analysis configuration if the option is shown.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="highlight">Analyze</span> to start processing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Batch upload</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Compress all your resumes into a single <span class="highlight">.zip</span> file.</li>
            <li>Upload the zip via the same file picker.</li>
            <li>Confirm the total number of resumes detected in the batch summary.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="highlight">Analyze</span> to launch a bulk analysis run.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note">
            Supported formats and limits (file types, size, and count per run) are enforced at upload time.
            If something is not accepted, you’ll see a clear validation message on the page.
        </p>

            <h2>Processing Pipeline</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            Once you submit an upload, the system pushes your files into an asynchronous
            processing pipeline. You can safely navigate away while the analysis runs.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="highlight">File intake</span> – documents are validated, stored, and assigned an internal run ID.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Text extraction</span> – PDFs and DOCX files are converted into clean, structured text.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Field parsing</span> – basic fields like name, contact details, education, and experience blocks are extracted.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">AI scoring</span> – specialized agents (see below) evaluate each candidate on different dimensions.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Aggregation</span> – scores and metadata are pushed into the analytics store used by the dashboard.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="tip">
            You can reopen the same analysis run later from the history or analytics view; there is no need
            to re-upload files unless the underlying resumes have changed.

            <h2>AI Agents Behind the Scenes</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            The analyzer uses multiple focused AI agents instead of a single monolithic model.
            Each agent is optimized for a specific part of the evaluation, which makes the results
            more interpretable and controllable.
        </p>

            <div class="agent-card">
                <div class="agent-title">Technical Agent</div>
                <p class="agent-desc">
                    Evaluates the candidate’s technical skills based on role, stack, and seniority.
                    It looks at languages, frameworks, systems design exposure, and depth vs. breadth.

                    surfacing how well the candidate aligns with the requirements and responsibilities.

        </div>

        <p class="note">
            Depending on your configuration, you may see only a subset of these agents. The analytics
            page shows which dimensions are active for a given run.

            <p class="pill">Step 3</p>
            <h2>Reading the Analytics Page</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            After processing completes, open the <span class="highlight">Analytics</span> page for the corresponding run.
            This is where you explore scores, comparisons, and detailed breakdowns for each candidate.
        </p>

        <h3>Key areas on the analytics page</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Run summary</span> – number of resumes processed, time taken, and basic distribution of scores.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Candidate table</span> – sortable list of candidates with overall scores and key tags.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Dimension breakdown</span> – technical, behavioral, and semantic‑fit scores side by side.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Drill‑down view</span> – per‑candidate view with agent‑level explanations and comments.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Use the filters and sorting controls to shortlist the most promising candidates:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sort by overall fit or a specific dimension (e.g., technical depth first).</li>
            <li>Filter by minimum score thresholds to focus on top percentiles.</li>
            <li>Open an individual candidate to understand <em>why</em> they scored the way they did.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="tip">
            A good workflow is: first shortlist candidates using the analytics view, then open their original
            resumes only for the final validation pass. This keeps the review process fast but still human‑in‑the‑loop.
